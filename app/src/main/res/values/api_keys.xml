    <!-- This file is where you should put in your APIs' keys -->
    <!-- Temporal way to proceed is:
        0. Copy this file's contents to a temporal file
        1. Remove all APIs' keys values in this file
        2. Add the new string name(s) for the new key(s)
        3. Remove the file from the .gitignore
        4. Check that there aren't any API key(s) in it, just the keys' string names
        5. Commit the file
        6. Add the file to the .gitignore again
        7. Copy again all APIs' keys from the temporal file
        8. Add the new key(s)
